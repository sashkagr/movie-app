                       Director-Movies Business Model
The core business model revolves around the relationship between Directors and the Movies they create.
Each Director can be associated with one or more Movies, while each Movie is directed by a single Director.

                      Entity Definitions:
        Director
           * Unique identifier (Long)
           * Name (varchar[255])
           * Description (some information about director) (TEXT)
           * List of movies
        Movie

           * Release year (1895 < n <= current year) (Integer)
           * Genre (varchar[255])
           * Plot summary

                       Relationships:
One-to-Many Relationship: Director-to-Movies
A Director can be associated with one or more Movies.
A Movie can only be directed by a single Director.

                        Key Business Rules:
A Director must be added to the system before any Movies they have directed can be added.
When a new Movie is added, the associated Director must be selected from the existing list of Directors.
When a Director is removed, all Movies associated with that Director will also be removed.
For the director, you can only update the name and description (not the list of movies).
To add or remove a film from the director, you must send a separate request to remove/add the movie.
